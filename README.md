# block-scroll-mod-x11

*Block a pointer device when a modifier key is pressed after scrolling has started in X11*

This software aims to eliminate the possible side effects of inertial scrolling that can occur when you press a modifier key after scrolling has started. This is supposed to work in operating systems that use [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).

**This master branch is reserved for C language implementation (or for some other language that has suitable xinput library).**

See e.g. *gawk* branch for a solution using GNU awk.
